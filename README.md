# jQuery-Scheduler

## Description
This repo consists of the code used to develop and run a functioning 'Work-Day Scheduler'. Designed to keep past, present, and upcoming events organized, this scheduler allows the user to save their work day events in designated time slots and color codes them in regards to the current time.

### Technologies
Project is created with:
- html
- css
- javascript/jQuery
- moment.js


## Functionality 
When run, the page will display the current date and time at the top, followed by empty time slots that correspond to the hours of an average work day. The user can add new events to the scheduler by writing a description in the desired time slot and clicking the "Save" button. Each time slot changes color in relation to the current time (Grey = past hour; red = current hour; green = upcoming hour).
